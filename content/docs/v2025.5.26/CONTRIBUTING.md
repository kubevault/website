# Contribution Guidelines

Want to hack on KubeVault?

This document outlines some of the conventions on
development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other
resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](https://github.com/kubevault/operator/blob/master/DCO) file for details.

## Bugs/Feature request

If you have found a bug with KubeVault or want to request for new features, please [file an issue](https://github.com/kubevault/project/issues/new).

## Submit PR


If you fix a bug or developed a new feature, feel free to submit a PR. In either case, please file a [Github issue](https://github.com/kubevault/project/issues/new) first, so that we can have a discussion on it. This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.

Thanks for your contributions!
